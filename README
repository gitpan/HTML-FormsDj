NAME
       HTML::FormsDj - Web Forms Module for Dancer and others.


DESCRIPTION

       The HTML::FormsDj module provides a comfortable way to maintain
       HTML form input. Its main use is for Dancer but can be used with
       other perl application servers as well, since it doesn't require
       Dancer to run at all.
       
       HTML::FormsDj aims to behave as much as Django's Forms system
       with the excpetion to do it the perl way and without a save feature.
